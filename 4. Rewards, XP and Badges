4. Rewards, XP and Badges

The Stacks program uses Talent Protocol’s progression system:

✔ XP

Used to measure progress across missions.

✔ Badges

Earned by completing Stacks categories (e.g., Builder, Explorer, Innovator).

✔ Streak Rewards

Daily or weekly consistency bonuses for staying active.

✔ Program Pools

Some campaigns include crypto rewards, STX token drops, or bonus XP for early contributors.

The more you participate, the more rewards you unlock — simple, fair, and motivating.
