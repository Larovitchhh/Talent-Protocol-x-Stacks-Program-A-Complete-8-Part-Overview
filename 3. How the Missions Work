3. How the Missions Work

Each Stacks mission inside Talent Protocol is a task designed to expose users to a different tool or function within the Stacks ecosystem.

Typical missions include:

Creating a Stacks wallet

Exploring the Hiro platform

Signing a transaction

Visiting a Stacks app or developer tool

Reading a Stacks resource

Completing an on-chain tutorial

Sharing something about Stacks on social media

When completed, each mission grants XP, which increases the user’s level and ranking in the program.
