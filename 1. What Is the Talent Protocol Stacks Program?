1. What Is the Talent Protocol Stacks Program?

Talent Protocol partners with Stacks to create an interactive onboarding experience for developers and community members.
Instead of passive tutorials, the program uses missions, quests, and progress milestones to help users:

Learn how Stacks works

Explore Stacks tools (Hiro, Clarinet, Stacks.js, wallets…)

Complete practical on-chain tasks

Earn XP, rewards, and badges

The program transforms learning Stacks into a fun, guided, and rewarding journey.
